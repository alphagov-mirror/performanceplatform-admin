// pyScss is buggy and occassionally outputs selectors in the wrong order.
// This leads to some selectors being overridden by less important ones, because
// ordering is important in CSS.
// Duplicate the below selector here so that it has a higher priority than in Bootstrap.
// See this bug in pyScss: https://github.com/Kronuz/pyScss/issues/269
